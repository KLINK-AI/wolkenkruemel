# Wolkenkruemel - Community Dog Training Platform

## Overview

Wolkenkruemel is a full-stack web application for dog training activities and community engagement. The platform allows users to create, share, and discover training activities while building a supportive community around dog training experiences.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration for subscription management
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL sessions with connect-pg-simple

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Schema Location**: `shared/schema.ts` for shared database schema
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database migrations in `./migrations` directory

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses a comprehensive schema with the following main entities:
- **Users**: User profiles with subscription tiers and activity tracking
- **Activities**: Training activities with difficulty levels and content
- **Posts**: Community posts with types (post, question, success_story)
- **Comments**: Nested comments on posts
- **Likes**: User interactions on posts and comments
- **Follows**: User following relationships
- **Events**: Community events and meetups
- **Notifications**: User notification system

### Authentication & Authorization
- Role-based access control (user, admin, moderator)
- Subscription-based feature gating (free, premium, professional)
- Stripe integration for subscription management

### Community Features
- Feed-based content discovery
- Q&A forum functionality
- Success story sharing
- User following and networking
- Trending topics and tags
- Event management

## Data Flow

### Content Creation Flow
1. User creates activity/post through form validation
2. Data validated with Zod schemas
3. Stored in PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
4. Real-time updates via React Query cache invalidation

### Community Interaction Flow
1. Users browse content via paginated feeds
2. Interactions (likes, comments, follows) update database
3. UI updates optimistically with React Query
4. Notifications triggered for relevant users

### Subscription Flow
1. Users select subscription tier
2. Stripe handles payment processing
3. Subscription status stored in user profile
4. Feature access controlled by subscription tier

- July 13, 2025. CRITICAL: Post-deployment data recovery completed - After deployment, activities disappeared from frontend but database remained intact with 18 activities and 6 users. Issue was Development environment using DatabaseStorage vs Production still using old version. Immediate redeployment required to restore full functionality for beta users.
- July 13, 2025. RESOLVED: Production-Development synchronization issue - Frontend showing "0 von 0 Aktivitäten" due to API 500 errors in production while development environment worked correctly. Root cause identified as production deployment not using latest DatabaseStorage implementation. Full system redeployment initiated to synchronize production environment with current codebase containing all 18 activities and 6 users from database.
- July 13, 2025. DEPLOYMENT: Manual deployment initiated via Replit Deploy button - User manually triggered deployment after identifying that automatic deployment system was not synchronizing with latest DatabaseStorage implementation. Development environment confirmed working with all 18 activities and proper API responses. Awaiting deployment completion to restore full production functionality.
- July 13, 2025. RESOLVED: Old deployment successfully deleted via "Shut down" button - User completed Step 1 of deployment reset process. Ready to create new deployment with current functional codebase. Development environment confirmed stable with all 18 activities loading correctly via API.
- July 13, 2025. CRITICAL: New deployment created but 500 errors persist - Second deployment attempt failed with same internal server errors. Root cause identified as build system not properly using DatabaseStorage implementation. Added comprehensive debugging logging to activities API route and created optimized backend build with esbuild. Development environment confirmed working (6 users, 18 activities). Ready for final deployment with enhanced error tracking.
